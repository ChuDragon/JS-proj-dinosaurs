# Course: Intermediate JavaScript
### Section: Object-Oriented JavaScript
### Project: Dinosaurs Infographic

## Student Developer: Roman Chuyan
The focus of this project was practicing object-oriented JavaScript, including creating a class, prototypes, and inheritance.
Other objectives were becoming comfortable with DOM manipulaiton and functional expressions such as IIFE.
I attempt to follow the ES6 syntax and to adhere to best practices on variable declaration and comments. 
This is a learning project (not meant for production), focusing on mastering the concepts rather than perfecting the app.
See Concepts Practiced below. Finally, I plan to leave the code as-is at this stage of my progress as a developer.

## Starter Code
Udacity supplied us with starter code containing the basic html/css and the starter JS code. 
My work was mostly in JavaScript, as well as some html/css to create an interactive, appealing UI.

## Setup/Dependencies
HTML protocol needs to run in order for the app to work. 
To do this, install a Live Server package/extension in your code editor. 
Open the project folder in the editor and start the Live Server package/extension. Then, open the 'index.html' file in your browser. 
The data is located in the `dinodata.js` file.

## Concepts Practiced

### Object-Oriented JS
I create a class with a constructor function, and create the necessary objects with both `new` and `Object.create()`. 

### Prototypical Inheritance
I add object methods using the `objName.prototype.` syntax.

### Interactivity, DOM Manipulation
I create/remove elements with the methods on the `document` object and `.innerHTML` element property.
